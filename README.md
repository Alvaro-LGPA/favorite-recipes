# Project: Favorite Recipes
## Project description
**Codecademy** excersise to introduce strategies for managing complex state in React applications using Redux

# Part I
#### Instructions
1. In the **store.js** file, begin by declaring a new variable called `initialState` and assign to it an empty object.
2. Now let‚Äôs add slices to the `initialState` object.
First, add an `allRecipes` property to the `initialState` object with an initial value of an empty array.
This array will be filled once we fetch the data from a database.
3. Next, add a `favoriteRecipes` property to the `initialState` object, also with an initial value of an empty array.
The user will select which recipes to add to this slice as their favorites.
4. Finally, add a `searchTerm` property to the `initialState` object with an initial value of an empty string.
The user will change this value by using a search input field.

```
// Store.js
const initialState = {
  allRecipes: [],
  favoriteRecipes: [],
  searchTerm: ""
};

```

1. Open up **./data.js** and you will see an array of recipe objects called `allRecipesData` is exported. Back in **store.js**, at the top of the file, this array is imported (later on, you will fetch data from an API rather than importing from a local file).
This array needs to be sent to the store so that it can populate the `state.allRecipes` slice, which is initially empty. This can be done using the `loadData()` action creator.
Complete the function `loadData()` such that it returns an action object with the following properties:
* `type`: The slice being modified is `state.allRecipes` and the action name is `'loadData'`
* `payload`: The `allRecipesData` array.
Remember to use the `‚ÄòsliceName/actionName‚Äô` pattern for type.

2. Next up is `addRecipe()` which should be dispatched when the user clicks on the ‚ù§Ô∏è icon of a particular recipe.
Notice that this function accepts a `recipe` parameter. The `recipe` object then needs to be sent to the store to be added to the `state.favoriteRecipes` slice. For example, this action might be dispatched like so:
```
const exampleRecipe = { 
  id: 4, 
  name: 'Cheeseburger', 
  img: 'img/cheeseburger.jpg'
}
store.dispatch(addRecipe(exampleRecipe));
```
Complete the function called `addRecipe()` such that it returns an action object with the following properties:

* `type`: The slice being modified is `state.favoriteRecipes` and the action name is `'addRecipe'`
* `payload`: The recipe object parameter.

3. The last action creator is `removeRecipe()` which should be dispatched when the user clicks on the üíî icon of a favorited recipe.
`removeRecipe()` also accepts a `recipe` parameter. The `recipe` object needs to be sent to the store so it knows which recipe to remove from the `state.favoriteRecipes` slice.
Complete the function called `removeRecipe()` such that it returns an action object with the following properties:

* type: The slice being modified is state.favoriteRecipes and the action name is 'removeRecipe'
* payload: The recipe object parameter.


#### Instructions
1. First up is the `searchTerm/setSearchTerm` action. This action will be dispatched with a payload whose value is the term to be set as the new value for `state.searchTerm`.
Within the `switch` statement of r`ecipesReducer()`, fix the case that handles the `'searchTerm/setSearchTerm'` action type.
For this case, the reducer should return a new state object with an updated `searchTerm` slice set to the new term provided by `action.payload`.
If done correctly, the second state printed to the console should show the search term set to `"cheese"`.

1. Now, let‚Äôs fix the case for the `favoriteRecipes/addRecipe` action type. This action will be dispatched with a payload whose value is the recipe object to be added to the `state.favoriteRecipes` array.
For this action type, the reducer should return a new state object with an updated `favoriteRecipes` slice.
The new value should be a new array that includes all the previously added values in addition to the new recipe (from `action.payload`) added to the end.
Remember, you must not mutate the incoming state object or the original `state.favoriteRecipes` array!

1. The final case to fix is for the `favoriteRecipes/removeRecipe` action type. This action will be dispatched with a payload whose value is the recipe object to be removed from the `state.favoriteRecipes` array.
For this case, the reducer should return a new state object with an updated `favoriteRecipes` slice.
The `favoriteRecipes` slice should be a new array that includes all the existing values from `state.favoriteRecipes` except for the recipe from `action.payload`.
We recommend that you use the `.filter()` array method and filter out the element whose `'id'` matches the recipe from action.payload.


#### Instructions
1. Currently, the default `favoriteRecipes` value for `favoriteRecipesReducer()` is the string `'REPLACE_ME'`. Let‚Äôs fix that.
First, declare a variable named `initialFavoriteRecipes` and assign it to an empty array (`[]`).
Then, assign the default `favoriteRecipes` value for `favoriteRecipesReducer()` to `initialFavoriteRecipes`.

1. Next, complete the `favoriteRecipesReducer` such that it immutably updates the `state.favoriteRecipes` slice in response to the following `action.type` cases:
   * `'favoriteRecipes/addRecipe'`: Return a new array with all of the prior values of `favoriteRecipes` with the `action.payload` value added to the end.
   * `'favoriteRecipes/removeRecipe'`: Return a new array with all of the prior values of `favoriteRecipes` with the `action.payload` value removed.
   * `default`: Return `favoriteRecipes` unchanged.

2. Well done! Now that you have the `favoriteRecipesReducer()` completed, you can use it within the `rootReducer` to update the `state.favoriteRecipes` slice.
Within `rootReducer()`, add a `favoriteRecipes` property to the `nextState` object.
Then, call `favoriteRecipesReducer()`, passing its slice of state and the action as arguments, and store the result as the value for `nextState.favoriteRecipes`.


#### Instructions
1. First, at the top of **store.js**, import `combineReducers` from the redux library.
2. `combineReducers()` accepts an object of reducers as its argument. Let‚Äôs create one!
At the bottom of **store.js**, create a variable called `reducers`. Assign to it an object with three properties: `allRecipes`, `favoriteRecipes`, `searchTerm`. Each property should be assigned its associated slice reducer.
3. Now, declare another variable called `rootReducer`. Call `combineReducers()` with the reducers object as an argument and assign the returned value to `rootReducer`.
4. Finally, pass the `rootReducer` to the `createStore()` function and save the returned value in a new variable called store.

#### Instructions
1. The reducers object passed to `combineReducers()` should contain the slice reducers responsible for updating the various slices of the `store`‚Äòs state. In the prior lesson, those slice reducers all existed in the same file. Now, you need to import them.
At the top of the **store.js** file, import the following values from their respective files:
`allRecipesReducer`
`favoriteRecipesReducer`
`searchTermReducer`
2. Excellent! Now that you have imported the slice reducers, you use them to construct the `reducers` object to be passed to `combineReducers()`.
Within the `reducers` object, add three `key:value` pairs where each `key` is the name of a slice and each `value` is the slice reducer responsible for managing that slice‚Äôs state.

3. Now that you have the `reducers` object, you can create the store using a combination of the `combineReducers()` and `createStore()` Redux functions.
You are going to do this all in one line of code!
First call `combineReducers()` with reducers as an argument.
Then, pass the entire `combineReducers(reducers)` function call as an argument to `createStore()`.
Finally, store the value returned by `createStore()` in a new variable called store.
4. Well done! You‚Äôve reconnected all of the slice reducers from separate files back into the `store` within **src/app/store.js**. In the next exercise, you‚Äôll learn how to build on this application structure by incorporating React components and dispatching actions from them. To do this, the store needs to be available to other parts of the application.
Export the `store` value from **src/app/store.js**.

```
import { createStore, combineReducers } from 'redux';

// Import the slice reducers here.
import { allRecipesReducer } from "../features/allRecipes/allRecipesSlice.js"
import { favoriteRecipesReducer } from "../features/favoriteRecipes/favoriteRecipesSlice.js"
import { searchTermReducer } from "../features/searchTerm/searchTermSlice.js"
const reducers = {
  // Add the slice properties here
  allRecipes: allRecipesReducer,
  favoriteRecipes: favoriteRecipesReducer,
  searchTerm: searchTermReducer
}

// Declare the store here.

export const store = createStore(combineReducers(reducers));


```

#### Instructions
1. In order to pass the store‚Äòs current state and its dispatch method to the `<App />` component, the `store` must first be imported into the **index.js** file.
At the top of **index.js**, import the store from **store.js**.

2. Next, get the current state of the store and pass it to the `<App />` component as a prop called `state`.
Note: You won‚Äôt see anything rendered until the next checkpoint!
3. The `<App />` component isn‚Äôt rendering yet because it is expecting to receive a `dispatch` method.
Pass the `store.dispatch` method to the `<App />` component as a prop called dispatch.
If done correctly, you should see the `<FavoriteRecipes />` and `<AllRecipes />` components rendered (without data, for now)!

4. Why is the recipe data not being rendered? Remember that the `state.allRecipes` slice begins as an empty array and the data is only loaded AFTER the user opens the page. This data fetch is happening but render isn‚Äôt subscribed to changes to the store yet!
At the bottom of `index.js`, use `store.subscribe()` to subscribe the render function to the store such that each time the store‚Äòs state changes, the entire `<App />` will be re-rendered.

#### Instructions

1. Open up the **App.js** file.
First, import the `FavoriteRecipes` component from the **FavoriteRecipes.js** file.

2. Now, you can add in the `<FavoriteRecipes />` component to the `<App />` component‚Äôs structure. Like the other two components, you will need to pass the `dispatch` method to the component as a prop.
The slice data passed to `<FavoriteRecipes />` will need to be filtered first based on the value of `state.searchTerm`. The filtered version of `state.favoriteRecipes` has been created for you and stored in the variable `visibleFavoriteRecipes`.
Within the return statement of the `<App />` component, in the space below the `<h2>Favorite Recipes</h2>` element, add in a `<FavoriteRecipes />` component. You should then pass along the following props:
* `favoriteRecipes`: the `visibleFavoriteRecipes` value
* `dispatch`: the `dispatch` method from the `store`.
If you complete this step correctly, you should see a blank square rendered under the ‚ÄúFavorite Recipes‚Äù header.
3. Open up the **FavoriteRecipes.js** file. The job of any presentational component in a Redux app is twofold:
1. Render the data for their associated slice of state.
1. Dispatch actions in response to user interaction within the component.
To do these two things, `<FavoriteRecipes />` was given two props: `favoriteRecipes` and `dispatch`.
At the top of `FavoriteRecipes()`, extract these two values from the props parameter.
4. Now that the `FavoriteRecipes()` component has access to the `favoriteRecipes` slice of state, you can render its data instead of the blank box! Take a look at the return statement:

```
return (
  <div className="recipes-container">
    {['REPLACE_ME'].map(createRecipeComponent)}
  </div>
);
```
Replace the entire `['REPLACE_ME']` array with the `favoriteRecipes` prop value.

If done correctly, every recipe object within `favoriteRecipes` will be mapped to a `<Recipe />` component and be rendered (try it out!).

5. The `<FavoriteRecipes />` component wants to dispatch an action to the store within `onRemoveRecipeHandler()`, but where are the action creators to help create those actions?
Remember, they have been moved to, and exported from, the **favoriteRecipesSlice.js** file!
At the top of **FavoriteRecipes.js**, import the action creator function, `removeRecipe`.

6. Finally, the `removeRecipe()` action creator accepts a `recipe` argument.
Within `onRemoveRecipeHandler()`, which receives a `recipe` parameter, dispatch a `removeRecipe()` action with `recipe` as an argument.

# Part II

Before continuing you should note the application‚Äôs current functionality that will be replaced in the following exercises:

* Calling `ReactDOM.render()` using `render()`.
* Passing `store.getState()` through `<App>` component props.
* Passing `store.dispatch` through `<App>` component props.
* Subscribing `render()` to the Redux store so it is called after state updates.
* Using the `props` parameter in **App.js** to pass data through the component, also known as **props drilling**.


#### Instructions
1. Before you can use the `<Provider>` component you must import it.
In the **index.js** file, create an import statement that retrieves the `Provider` component from `react-redux`.
2. The next step is to insert the `<Provider>` component into the recipe application.
Inside `ReactDOM.render()`, wrap the top level component, `<App>` with the `<Provider>` component.
3. With the `<App>` component now nested inside the `<Provider>` component, pass the imported Redux store through the `<Provider>` component store prop.
This begins the process of accessing data throughout the application components but you must do a couple more things to see any progress.

#### Instructions

1. First, you need to implement the `selectAllRecipes` selector.
Towards the bottom of **allRecipesSlice.js**, implement `selectAllRecipes` and test the code:
   1. Start with an x statement
   2. Define `selectAllRecipes` with `state` as the only argument
   3. Return the allRecipes piece of the `state`

    > State es un placeholder. Puede llamarse como quieras
1. You can now implement a new selector that retrieves the recipes based on the `searchTerm` in the `state`.
Below the `selectAllRecipes` selector:
    1. Start with an `export` statement
    1. Define `selectFilteredAllRecipes` with `state` as the only argument

1. You will use the `selectAllRecipes` and `selectSearchTerm` to retrieve data for `selectFilteredAllRecipes`.
Inside the function body of `selectFilteredAllRecipes`, create two variables:
    * `allRecipes` and assign the return value of `selectAllRecipes(state)`
    * `searchTerm` and assign the return value of `selectSearchTerm(state)`

4. Now you have an array of the recipes in `allrecipes` and the current search term string in `searchTerm`. To get a filtered list of recipes based on the search term you will use the JavaScript array `filter()` method.
Inside `selectFilteredAllRecipes`, call `allRecipes.filter()` with the following callback function as the argument:
    ```
    recipe => recipe.name.toLowerCase().includes(searchTerm.toLowerCase())
    ```
        Then, return the result.

Selectors can be simple or complex. All are an important step to accessing the Redux store data within components.

#### Instructions

1. To access Redux store data with `useSelector()`, you first need to import it from react-redux.
In **AllRecipes.js** import `useSelector` from `react-redux`.

2. Along with `useSelector()` you need access to the `selectFilteredAllRecipes` selector defined in the previous exercise.
In **AllRecipes.js** add `selectFilteredAllRecipes` to the **allRecipesSlice.js** import statement.
3. With both import statements complete, you are now able to access the data using the selector function and `useSelector()`.
Inside the `AllRecipes()` component function:
    1. Define a variable `allRecipes`.
    1. Assign it the value returned by `useSelector()`.
    1. Pass selectFilteredAllRecipes to `useSelector()`.

    In this exercise, the data was initialized with recipes so when you run the code you should see the recipe data rendered in the browser.

#### Instructions

1. In **AllRecipes.js:**
    * Add `useDispatch` to the `react-redux` import statement.
    * Create a variable `dispatch` inside the All`Recipes component and assign it the reference returned by `useDispatch()`.

2. In **FavoriteRecipes.js**, `useDispatch` has been added to the import statement and the `dispatch` reference has been defined. Use `dispatch` to dispatch the action inside one of the handler functions.

Inside the `onRemoveRecipeHandler` function:

   * Dispatch an action using `dispatch()`
   * Pass the `removeRecipe()` action creator to `dispatch()`.
   * Pass `recipe` to the action creator.
